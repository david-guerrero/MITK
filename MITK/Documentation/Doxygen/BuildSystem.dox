<dt>MITK_MULTIPLEX_PICTYPE</dt>
</dl>
generates separated source files for different
data types to reduce memory consumption of compiler during template 
instantiation, e.g. by mitkInstantiateAccessFunctions.h

Usage: \c MITK_MULTIPLEX_PICTYPE(file) 

Param "file" should be named like \c mitkMyAlgo-TYPE.cpp .
In the file, every occurence of \c \@TYPE\@ is replaced by the
datatype. For each datatype, a new file \c mitkMyAlgo-datatype.cpp 
is generated and added to \c CPP_FILES_GENERATED.
