This tutorial gives an introduction to MITK. 
We will start with the first steps of just compiling what you get after downloading MITK, continue to show how to
display and do basic interaction with images, and finally show how to build an application module (functionality).

The source code of the examples can be found in mitk/QApplications/Tutorial/ \n
Two data files are used to execute the example code. They are located in mitk/Core/Code/Testing/Data/

\li Pic3D.pic.gz \n
