\section QmitkImageStatisticsUserManualUsage Usage

After selection of an image or a binary mask of an image in the datamanader the Image Statistics module shows some statistical information. If a mask is selected the name of the mask and the name of the image this mask is applied to are shown at the top.

Below that are the statistics window, which displays the calculated statistical features (such as mean, standard deviation...) and the histogram.

At the bottom of the module are two buttons. They copy their respective data in csv format to the clipboard.
