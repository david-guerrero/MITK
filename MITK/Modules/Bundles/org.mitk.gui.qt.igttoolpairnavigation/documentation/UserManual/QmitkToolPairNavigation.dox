/**
\bundlemainpage{org.toolpairnavigation} IGT Tool Pair Navigation

 This plugin can be used to guide one tracking tool to another tracking tool. 
 
  The plugin connects to a tracking system and shows the connected/added tools in two 3D widgets (standard 3D widget is interactable, the other (widget2) isn't).
  Furthermore it calculates the distance between the two tools and displays it in GUI. 
  In widget 4 the tool connected on port b is shown from the point of view of the tool in port a.
