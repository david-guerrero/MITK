 /** Documentation:
  *   \brief An object of this class offers an UI to configurate
  *          a tracking device. If the user finished the configuration process and
  *          a fully configurated tracking device is availiabe the object emits a
  *          signal "TrackingDeviceConfigurationFinished()". You can then get the
  *          tracking device by calling the method GetTrackingDevice().
  *          
  *          Once the tracking device is configurated there are two ways to reset
  *          the UI to allow the user for configuring a new device. The method Reset()
  *          can be called and there is also a button "reset" which can be pressed by
  *          the user. In both cases a signal "TrackingDeviceConfigurationReseted()"
  *          is emitted and you may wait for a new configurated tracking device.
  *
  *          The possibility to reset the configuration by the user can also be switched
  *          of by calling the method EnableUserReset(boolean enable).
