/**
  \brief Abstract base class for segmentation tools.

  \sa Tool

  \ingroup Interaction
  \ingroup ToolManagerEtAl

  Implements 2D segmentation specific helper methods, that might be of use to
  all kind of 2D segmentation tools. At the moment these are:
   - Determination of the slice where the user paints upon (DetermineAffectedImageSlice)
   - Projection of a 3D contour onto a 2D plane/slice

   SegTool2D tries to structure the interaction a bit. If you pass "PressMoveRelease" as the interaction type
   of your derived tool, you might implement the methods OnMousePressed, OnMouseMoved, and OnMouseReleased. 
   Yes, your guess about when they are called is correct.

  \warning Only to be instantiated by mitk::ToolManager.
