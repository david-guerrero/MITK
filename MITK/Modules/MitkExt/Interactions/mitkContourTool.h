  \brief Simple contour filling tool.

  \sa FeedbackContourTool
  \sa ExtractImageFilter
  \sa OverwriteSliceImageFilter
  
  \ingroup Interaction
  \ingroup ToolManagerEtAl

  Fills a visible contour (from FeedbackContourTool) during mouse dragging. When the mouse button
  is released, ContourTool tries to extract a slice from the working image and fill in
  the (filled) contour as a binary image.

  The painting "color" is defined by m_PaintingPixelValue, which is set in the constructor
  (by sub-classes) or during some event (e.g. in OnInvertLogic - when CTRL is pressed). 

  \warning Only to be instantiated by mitk::ToolManager.
