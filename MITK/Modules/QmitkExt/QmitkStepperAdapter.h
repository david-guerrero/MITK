//##Documentation
//## @brief Helper class to connect Qt-based navigators to instances of Stepper
//##
//## The constructor has to be provided with the \a Navigator 
//## that wants to use the \a Stepper. The \a Navigator has to define the
//## slots \a Refetch() and \a SetStepper(mitk::Stepper *). \a SetStepper will be
//## called only once to pass the \a Stepper to the \a Navigator. When the values of
//## the \a Stepper changes, \a Refetch() will be called. The \a Navigator can than
//## ask the \a Stepper for its new values.
//## \warning The \a Navigator has to be aware that it might have caused the changes 
//## of the \a Stepper itself. So take care that no infinite recursion is created!
