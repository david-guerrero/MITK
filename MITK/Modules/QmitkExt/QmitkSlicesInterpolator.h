  There is a separate page describing the general design of QmitkInteractiveSegmentation: \ref QmitkInteractiveSegmentationTechnicalPage

  While mitk::SegmentationInterpolation does the bookkeeping of interpolation 
  (keeping track of which slices contain how much segmentation) and the algorithmic work, 
  QmitkSlicesInterpolator is responsible to watch the GUI, to notice, which slice is currently
  visible. It triggers generation of interpolation suggestions and also triggers acception of
  suggestions.
