 \section DicomSeriesReader_purpose Purpose

 DicomSeriesReader serves as a central class for loading DICOM images as mitk::Image.
 As the term "DICOM image" covers a huge variety of possible modalities and 
 implementations, and since MITK assumes that 3D images are made up of continuous blocks
 of slices without any gaps or changes in orientation, the loading mechanism must
 implement a number of decisions and compromises.

 <b>The main intention of this implementation is not efficiency but correcness of generated slice positions!</b>

 \section DicomSeriesReader_limitations Assumptions and limitations

 The class is working only with GDCM 2.0.14 (or possibly newer). This version is the
 default of an MITK super-build. Support for other versions or ITK's DicomIO was dropped
 because of the associated complexity of DicomSeriesReader.

 \b Assumptions
  - expected to work for SOP Classes CT Image Storage and MR Image Storage (NOT for the "Enhanced" variants containing multi-frame images)
  - special treatment for a certain type of Philips 3D ultrasound (recogized by tag 3001,0010 set to "Philips3D")
  - loader will always attempt to read multiple single slices as a single 3D image volume (i.e. mitk::Image)
    - slices will be grouped by basic properties such as orientation, rows, columns, spacing and grouped into as large blocks as possible
  
 \b Options
  - images that cover the same piece of space (i.e. position, orientation, and dimensions are equal)
    can be interpreted as time-steps of the same image, i.e. a series will be loaded as 3D+t

 \b Limitations
  - the 3D+t assumption only works if all time-steps have an equal number of slices and if all
    have the Acquisition Time attribute set to meaningful values
  - Images from tilted CT gantries CAN ONLY be loaded as a series of single-slice images, since
    mitk::Image or the accompanying mapper are not (yet?) capable of representing such geometries
  - Secondary Capture images are expected to have the (0018,2010) tag describing the pixel spacing.
    If only the (0028,0030) tag is set, the spacing will be misinterpreted as (1,1)

 \section DicomSeriesReader_usage Usage

 The starting point for an application is a set of DICOM files that should be loaded.
 For convenience, DicomSeriesReader can also parse a whole directory for DICOM files,
 but an application should better know exactly what to load.

 Loading is then done in two steps:

  1. <b>Group the files into spatial blocks</b> by calling GetSeries(). 
     This method will sort all passed files into meaningful blocks that
     could fit into an mitk::Image. Sorting for 3D+t loading is optional but default.
     The \b return value of this function is a list of identifiers similar to
     DICOM UIDs, each associated to a sorted list of file names.

  2. <b>Load a sorted set of files</b> by calling LoadDicomSeries().
     This method expects go receive the sorting output of GetSeries().
     The method will then invoke ITK methods to actually load the
     files into memory and put them into mitk::Images. Again, loading
     as 3D+t is optional.
 
  Example:

\code

 // only a directory is known at this point: /home/who/dicom

 DicomSeriesReader::UidFileNamesMap allImageBlocks = DicomSeriesReader::GetSeries("/home/who/dicom/");

 // file now divided into groups of identical image size, orientation, spacing, etc.
 // each of these lists should be loadable as an mitk::Image.

 DicomSeriesReader::StringContainer seriesToLoad = allImageBlocks[...]; // decide what to load

 // final step: load into DataNode (can result in 3D+t image)
 DataNode::Pointer node = DicomSeriesReader::LoadDicomSeries( oneBlockSorted );

 Image::Pointer image = dynamic_cast<mitk::Image*>( node->GetData() );
\endcode

 \section DicomSeriesReader_sorting Logic for sorting 2D slices from DICOM images into 3D+t blocks for mitk::Image

 The general sorting mechanism (implemented in GetSeries) groups and sorts a set of DICOM files, each assumed to contain a single CT/MR slice.
 In the following we refer to those file groups as "blocks", since this is what they are meant to become when loaded into an mitk::Image.
 
 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting1 Step 1: Avoiding pure non-sense

 A first pass separates slices that cannot possibly be loaded together because of restrictions of mitk::Image.
 After this steps, each block contains only slices that match in all of the following DICOM tags:

   - (0020,0037) Image Orientation
   - (0028,0030) Pixel Spacing
   - (0018,0050) Slice Thickness
   - (0028,0010) Number Of Rows
   - (0028,0011) Number Of Columns
   - (0020,000e) Series Instance UID : could be argued about, might be dropped in the future (optionally)
 
 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting2 Step 2: Sort slices spatially

 Before slices are further analyzed, they are sorted spatially. As implemented by GdcmSortFunction(),
 slices are sorted by
   1. distance from origin (calculated using (0020,0032) Image Position Patient and (0020,0037) Image Orientation)
   2. when distance is equal, (0008,0032) Acquisition Time is used as a backup criterion (necessary for meaningful 3D+t sorting)

 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting3 Step 3: Ensure equal z spacing

 Since inter-slice distance is not recorded in DICOM tags, we must ensure that blocks are made up of
 slices that have equal distances between neighboring slices. This is especially necessary because itk::ImageSeriesReader
 is later used for the actual loading, and this class expects (and does nocht verify) equal inter-slice distance.

 To achieve such grouping, the inter-slice distance is calculated from the first two different slice positions of a block. 
 Following slices are added to a block as long as they can be added by adding the calculated inter-slice distance to the
 last slice of the block. Slices that do not fit into the expected distance pattern, are set aside for further analysis.
 This grouping is done until each file has been assigned to a group.

 Slices that share a position in space are also sorted into separate blocks during this step. 
 So the result of this step is a set of blocks that contain only slices with equal z spacing 
 and uniqe slices at each position.

 \subsection DicomSeriesReader_sorting4 Step 4 (optional): group 3D blocks as 3D+t when possible

 This last step depends on an option of GetSeries(). When requested, image blocks from the previous step are merged again
 whenever two blocks occupy the same portion of space (i.e. same origin, number of slices and z-spacing).
 
 \section DicomSeriesReader_tests Tests regarding DICOM loading

 A number of tests have been implemented to check our assumptions regarding DICOM loading. Please see \ref DICOMTesting
