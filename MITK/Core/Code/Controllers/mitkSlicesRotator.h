/**
 * \brief Enables rotation of visible slices (for sliced geometries).
 * \ingroup NavigationControl
 *
 * This class takes care of several SliceNavigationControllers and handles 
 * slice selection / slice rotation. It is added as listener to 
 * GlobalInteraction by QmitkStdMultiWidget.
 *
 * The SlicesRotator class adds the possibility of slice rotation to the
 * "normal" behaviour of SliceNavigationControllers. This additional class
 * is needed, because one has to be aware of several "visible slices" 
 * (selected Geometry2Ds of some SliceNavigationControllers) in order to
 * choose between rotation and slice selection.
 *
 * Rotation is achieved by modifying (rotating) the generated
 * TimeSlicedGeometry of the corresponding SliceNavigationController.
 *
 * With SlicesRotator, the rule to choose between slice rotation and 
 * selection is simple: For a mouse down event, count the number of visible
 * planes, which are "near" the cursor. If this number equals 2 (one for the 
 * window, which currently holds the cursor, one for the intersection line of
 * another visible slice), then initiate rotation, else select slices near 
 * the cursor. If "LinkPlanes" is set to true, the rotation is applied to the
 * planes of all registered SNCs, not only of the one associated with the
 * directly selected plane.
 *  
 * In contrast to the situation without the SlicesRotator, the
 * SliceNavigationControllers are now not directly registered as listeners to 
 * GlobalInteraction. SlicesRotator is registered as a listener and decides 
 * whether something should be rotated or whether another slice should be 
 * selected. In the latter case, a PositionEvent is just forwarded to the 
 * SliceNavigationController.
