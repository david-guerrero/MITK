Changes made to the source code of TinyXML
(should be checked when updating the source code)
================================================================================

We set the flag TIXML_USE_XML when compiling the library.

Since most headers look differnt depending on whether this flag ist set or not
we changed the headers by adding a 

#define TIXML_USE_XML

at the top of each header.

If we wouldn't do this change in the original headers, we would have to put a line

ADD_DEFINITIONS(-DTIXML_USE_XML)

into each MITK module/application that wants to use TinyXML with STL strings.
